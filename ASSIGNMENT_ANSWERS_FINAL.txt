BANA 5210: MODULE 3.3 ASSIGNMENT - PERSONAL ANALYSIS
===================================================

QUESTION 1: Identify the subindustry with the highest company count.
After merging the GICS subindustry classifications, I found that the Biotechnology sector (35201010) is significantly more populated than any other, housing a total of 74 firms from the Middle 1000 dataset.

QUESTION 2: Identify a subindustry with a single company.
My analysis revealed several subindustries represented by only one company; I specifically noted Drug Retail (30101010) and Integrated Oil & Gas (10102010) as prime examples of these isolated classifications.

QUESTION 3: What problem do you have using these GICS subindustries as a way to identify companies similar to one another?
The primary issue I see with GICS is its rigid, top-down nature. It often forces companies with fundamentally different business models or technological focuses into the same bucket. It’s a classic case of a taxonomy being too broad to capture the actual operational nuances that matter for a real investment analysis.

QUESTION 4: Does the grouping in GICS subindustry 30201030 (Soft Drinks) make sense?
Yes, this grouping actually felt quite cohesive to me. When I looked at the firms in 30201030, they all share very similar production, distribution, and branding strategies, which makes the GICS classification fairly effective for this particular niche.

QUESTION 5: Does the grouping in GICS subindustry 35201010 (Biotechnology) make sense?
I don’t think this grouping makes nearly as much sense. It feels like a "catch-all" sector where you have everything from oncology research to diagnostic manufacturing. The common label masks a huge amount of diversity in R&D intensity and market application, which makes it a noisy tool for finding true peers.

QUESTION 6: How do SIIX, DSGN, and FL compare in their primary and secondary topic weights?
I observed a lot of variation here. Foot Locker is the most "pure-play" with a massive 89.2% weight on its retail topic. Meanwhile, Six Flags (SIIX) is more distributed, putting 66.3% on its primary topic and a solid 17.7% on its secondary. Design Therapeutics (DSGN) was the most balanced, splitting its weight almost evenly—around 49% and 48%—between scientific research and clinical study topics.

QUESTION 7: Do the topic probabilities for SIIX, DSGN, and FL make sense given their business activities?
They make total sense to me. Foot Locker’s high retail concentration reflects its massive store footprint and product focus. For Six Flags, the mix of entertainment and content topics fits their media-integrated theme park model. And for a biotech like DSGN, that 50/50 split between protein research and clinical trials perfectly captures the two core stages of their drug development lifecycle.

QUESTION 8: List the top 10 companies closest to SIIX by Hellinger distance and evaluate if they make sense.
My top 10 list for Six Flags included Golden Entertainment (GDEN), Monarch Casino (MCRI), and Cedar Fair (FUN). Most of these, especially the gaming and theme park operators, make a lot of sense as peers. However, as the distance increases, I noticed it starts to drift toward real estate firms like St. Joe Co (JOE), which share some land-use characteristics but aren't strictly entertainment peers.

QUESTION 9: List the top 10 companies closest to DSGN by Hellinger distance and evaluate if they make sense.
The comparables I found for DSGN were incredibly strong. Firms like Vaxcyte (PCVX) and Verve Therapeutics (VERV) showed very tight distances (0.03-0.04). All of them are biotech peers with very similar R&D profiles, which suggests the model is doing an excellent job of matching firms based on their actual scientific and clinical focus.

QUESTION 10: List the top 10 companies closest to FL by Hellinger distance and evaluate if they make sense.
Foot Locker had the tightest clustering of all. My list included direct competitors like Children’s Place (PLCE), Guess (GES), and Boot Barn (BOOT) with incredibly low distances (down to 0.006). These firms are running almost identical retail business models, so these results are spot-on for an investment comparison.

QUESTION 11: List the top 10 words for SIIX, DSGN, and FL and identify similarities or differences.
When I looked at word frequencies, the differences were stark. SIIX is all about "park," "flag," and "ride," reflecting their service-based model. DSGN’s vocabulary is much more technical—think "disease," "genetic," and "nucleotide." FL is firmly grounded in retail logistics, focusing on "store," "athletic," and "sneaker." While they might all use general terms like "brand," their core operational language is entirely distinct.

QUESTION 12: What assumptions can be made about the mechanism underlying Hellinger distance based on these results?
I’ve concluded that Hellinger distance measures the statistical overlap between businesses through a latent lens. It’s not just counting words; it's weighing how a firm's activities are distributed across thematic clusters. It effectively identifies that two companies are "similar" even if they use slightly different terminology, as long as their vocabulary belongs to the same underlying topic profile.

QUESTION 13: Which of the three has the strongest/weakest list of comparables, and which approach (GICS or Topic Modeling) is more helpful?
In my view, Foot Locker has the strongest list because the distances are incredibly tight and the peers are direct competitors. Six Flags has the weakest, as its results tend to drift into adjacent sectors like real estate. Overall, I find the Hellinger distance/topic modeling approach far more helpful than GICS. Topic modeling provides a dynamic, bottom-up view of similarity that captures actual operational alignment, whereas GICS is just a blunt organizational tool that often misses the mark.
