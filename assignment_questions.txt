Module 3.3 Assignment
Using Groupings to Find  Comparable Companies
Instructions
Use the Codio embed on the Module 3.3 Assignment page in Canvas to build lists of comparable companies, using GICS subindustry groupings first and then Hellinger distance from a single company to evaluate their comparative efficacy mapping similarities relevant to the business activities of the Middle 1000 companies. Once you have achieved all tasks in Codio, answer the questions present in the “Assignment Tasks” section of this document.
Except as indicated, use this document to record responses to any questions. At a minimum, you will need to turn in a digital copy of this document to your instructor as part of your assignment completion, although there may be additional supporting documents that you need to submit. 
Note: Though your work will only be seen by those grading the course and will not be used or shared outside the course, you should take care to obscure any information you feel might be of a sensitive or confidential nature.
Submit this document on the Module 3.3 Assignment page in Canvas. Information about the grading rubric is available on that same page. Do not hesitate to contact your instructor if you have any questions about the assignment.
